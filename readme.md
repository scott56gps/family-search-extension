I have an authentication and add card example up and running.

Run `trelloAuthenticateExample.html` under a live server at port 8000.  Type the following into the address bar of the browser:

`https://localhost:8000/trelloAuthenticateExample.html`

The open in browser option for Brackets will not work.
